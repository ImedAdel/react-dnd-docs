# React DnD Docs

This is the source code for a new React DnD documentation website.

The old website was getting dusty, so, while working on a project using React DnD and having to learn the whole API, I decided to help you—time traveler—by making a shinier website that you can depend on in your drag and drop journey.

This website won't be a pure stylistic update to the old. Instead, I am planning to reguraly enhance the documentation and—hopefully—add more examples.

PS. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/imedadel_).

## Contribute

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

Each page has an edit link at the end. If you would like to help me, please feel free to do so.
